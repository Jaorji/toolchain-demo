template.name: "Microservices toolchain with GitHub Enterprise~otc-ui1208"
template.description: "With this cloud-native toolchain, you use a sample to create an online store that consists of three microservices: a Catalog API, an Orders API, and a UI that calls both of the APIs. The toolchain is preconfigured for continuous delivery, source control, blue-green deployment, functional testing, issue tracking, and online editing.\n\nThe Catalog and Orders API are backed by a Cloudant store. As part of deploying this application a Cloudant service instance will be created. For more information and terms, see the [Bluemix catalog](/catalog/services/cloudant-nosql-db/).\n\nThis toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service. If an instance of that service isn't already in your organization, when you click **Create**, it is automatically added. For more information and terms, see the [Bluemix catalog](/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/).\n\nTo get started, click **Create**.~otc-ui1209"
template.gettingStarted: "**Your toolchain is ready!**\n**Quick start:** Commit a change to a Git repo to trigger a new build and deployment of one of the microservices. See results in the Deployment Risk dashboard in DevOps Insights.\nFor step-by-step instructions, see the [tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/devops/method/tutorials/tutorial_toolchain_microservices?task=3) for this toolchain.~otc-ui1210"
